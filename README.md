# AWS S3 - Upload and Download Playground

I created a simple application to download and upload to Amazon S3. 

I'm using: [AWSS3TransferUtility](http://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-ios/docs/reference//Classes/AWSS3TransferUtility.html) for this job. 

Demo of application: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1pNdjg-uLY
